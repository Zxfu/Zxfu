Oh Hey, I see that you've stumbled upon my profile,
Welcome!

Let me introduce myself, my name is Kennith but I
Go by the name Zxfu on the Internet. I am 16 years old
And love to play video games. I play games known as Call of duty,
Apex legends, and Minecraft. 

I recently got into coding a few months back, my friend Cosmic explained coding and what it could benefit me since I was looking into plugin development for minecraft bedrock, my first language I tried
Was PHP. The reason I chose PHP because I got into making minecraft servers
And I wanted to make my own plugins for my Minecraft bedrock server so my Server would be custom and different and standout better from all the other servers.
From all the other minecraft Bedrock servers!

The second language I'm learning currently right now and plan on mastering is C#.
The main reason I chose C# is because I want to make my own games and web applications and apps.
I use the engine Unity to create game projects. I've been into C# for 2 months and still learning everyday!

The next languages I plan on learning and mastering is Java, and JavaScript. I want to know these languages to code Minecraft Java plugins and to make my own Discord bots.

Remember never give up! Keep going!
